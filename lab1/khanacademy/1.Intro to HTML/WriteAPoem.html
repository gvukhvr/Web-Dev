    <h1> The Rainbow </h1>
    <p> Boats sail on the rivers,<br>
And ships sail on the seas;<br>
But clouds that sail across the sky<br>
Are prettier far than these.<br>
<br>
There are bridges on the rivers,<br>
As pretty as you please;<br>
But the bow that bridges heaven,<br>
And overtops the trees,<br>
And builds a road from earth to sky,<br>
Is prettier far than these. </p>
